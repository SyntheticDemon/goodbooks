# goodbooks
A book reviewing website made from scratch by me using Django for backend 
For now the service can handle creating categories and subcategories and book creation from the admin panel
new functionalities will be added over time , the frontend design and color pallete were all done by me  my self and I , nothing is copied from anywhere
Insipirations have been taken from websites like Digikala and Good Reads
