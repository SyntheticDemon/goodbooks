A book reviewing website built by me using django for backend ,JQuery for Async Proccessing and standard templating languages
For now the website supports Book reviewing , Account Creation ,Login , An unfinihsed Profile Page .
The goal is to after completing all features , hook the website up to the Google Book API and make the product dynamically change
